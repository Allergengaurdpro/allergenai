2. âœ… "Product found!" success message
3. âœ… Pre-filled product name and brand
4. âœ… Ingredients automatically loaded
5. âœ… Product image displayed
6. âœ… Allergens detected from ingredients
7. âœ… Green banner showing "Product found in Open Food Facts database!"

### If Product Not Found:
- You'll see "Product not found in database"
- Form will be empty for manual entry
- This is normal - not all products are in the database

## Mock Data Included

The app comes pre-loaded with:

- **3 Users** (1 manager, 2 receivers)
- **3 Vendors** with receiver assignments
- **2 Products** in the database
- **2 Scanning Sessions** (completed and submitted)
- **5 Inventory Items** with various allergens

## Testing Allergen Detection

Try entering these ingredients to test allergen detection:

### High Priority Allergens:
- **Peanuts:** "Contains peanuts, peanut oil"
- **Tree Nuts:** "Made with almonds, cashews, walnuts"
- **Milk:** "Contains milk, butter, cheese, whey, lactose"
- **Eggs:** "Eggs, egg whites, mayonnaise"
- **Fish:** "Salmon, tuna, anchovy extract"
- **Shellfish:** "Shrimp, lobster, crab meat"
- **Soy:** "Soy sauce, soybean oil, tofu, soy lecithin"
- **Wheat:** "Wheat flour, gluten, graham crackers"
- **Sesame:** "Sesame seeds, tahini, sesame oil"

### Medium Priority Allergens:
- **Mustard:** "Mustard, mustard seeds"
- **Sulphites:** "Contains sulphites, sodium bisulfite"

### Multiple Allergens:
Try: "Wheat flour, milk, eggs, butter, soy lecithin, peanut oil, almonds. Contains: wheat, milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, tree nuts"

This will trigger a **high-risk warning** (3+ allergens).

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in **localStorage**, so:
- Data persists across page refreshes
- Each browser/device has separate data
- Clear localStorage to reset: Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage â†’ Clear All

## Known Limitations (Testing Mode)

1. **Barcode Scanner:** Camera scanning is functional but manual entry is easier for testing
2. **OCR:** Returns mock data instead of actual text extraction
3. **Open Food Facts:** Requires internet connection (works with real API)
4. **Image Upload:** Works but returns placeholder URLs in mock mode
5. **No Backend:** All data except Open Food Facts is local to your browser

## Troubleshooting

### Open Food Facts not working?
- âœ… Check internet connection
- âœ… Open browser console (F12) to see API responses
- âœ… Try different barcodes from the list above
- âœ… Some products may not exist in the database

### CORS Issues?
- Open Food Facts API supports CORS, should work from localhost
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

## Switching to Firebase

When ready for production:
1. Update imports in all files from `mockFirebase` back to `firebase`
2. Configure Firebase credentials in `src/config/firebase.js`
3. Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
4. All functionality will work with real backend

## Support

If you encounter any issues during testing, check:
- Browser console for errors (F12)
- Network tab for API calls
- localStorage for data persistence
- React DevTools for component state

Happy Testing! ðŸŽ‰
