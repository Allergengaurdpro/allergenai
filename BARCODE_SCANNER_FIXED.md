## ❌ Troubleshooting

### "Camera not accessible"
- **Grant camera permissions** when browser asks
- **Use HTTPS or localhost** - required for camera access
- **Check browser settings** → Allow camera for this site

### "Scanner not detecting"
- **Improve lighting** - turn on lights
- **Move closer/farther** - try 20cm distance
- **Hold steady** - keep still for 1-2 seconds
- **Use manual entry** - type barcode as backup

### "Can't access on phone"
- **Same WiFi** - ensure phone and PC on same network
- **Firewall** - allow port 3000 in firewall
- **Try ngrok** - works from any network
