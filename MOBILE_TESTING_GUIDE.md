## 🚀 How to Test on Your Phone

### Method 1: Test on Your Local Network (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Get Your Computer's IP Address

**On Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep inet
```
Look for your local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

#### Step 2: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see output like:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

#### Step 3: Access on Your Phone

1. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network** as your computer
2. **Open your phone's browser** (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
3. **Type the Network URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5173`)
4. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted

### Method 2: Use ngrok (For Remote Testing)

If your phone is on a different network:

#### Step 1: Install ngrok
```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

#### Step 2: Start Your App
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Step 3: In a New Terminal, Run ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 5173
```

#### Step 4: Use the ngrok URL
You'll get a URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

Open this URL on your phone!

## 📸 Testing the Barcode Scanner

### Step 1: Open the Scanner
1. Login to the app
2. Go to Receiver Dashboard
3. Click on a vendor
4. Click **"Start Scanning Session"**
5. Click **"Scan Barcode"** button

### Step 2: Grant Camera Permission
- Your phone will ask for camera permission
- **Click "Allow"** - this is required!

### Step 3: Scan a Barcode

**Test Barcodes to Try:**
- 📦 **737628064502** - Nutella
- 🥤 **5000112548871** - Coca-Cola
- 🍫 **3017620422003** - Nutella (France)

**Tips for Best Results:**
- ✅ Hold phone 15-30cm from barcode
- ✅ Ensure good lighting
- ✅ Keep barcode parallel to camera
- ✅ Hold steady for 1-2 seconds
- ✅ The scanner automatically focuses on the barcode

### Step 4: Manual Entry (Backup)
If camera doesn't work, you can always:
1. Type the barcode manually
2. Click "Submit"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Camera not working"
**Solution:** Grant camera permissions
- On Android: Settings → Apps → Your Browser → Permissions → Camera (Allow)
- On iOS: Settings → Safari → Camera (Allow)

### ❌ "Cannot access camera"
**Solution:** Use HTTPS
- Camera access requires secure connection
- Use ngrok (provides HTTPS automatically)
- Or use your network IP (works on same WiFi)

### ❌ "Scanner not detecting barcode"
**Solutions:**
1. Improve lighting (turn on lights)
2. Move phone closer/farther (try 20cm distance)
3. Ensure barcode is in focus
4. Try a different barcode
5. Use manual entry as backup

### ❌ "Page not loading on phone"
**Solutions:**
1. Check phone and computer are on same WiFi
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 5173
3. Try using ngrok instead
